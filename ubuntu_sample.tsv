6	how to set up a headless server ?	i have a ubuntu development server at work . it is an old rack server that is located somewhere in the company 's dungeon , where nobody ever goes . the only way it can work is as a so-called headless server ( i.e . with no monitor/keyboard connected and only accepting network connections ) . obviously , if you just need terminal access ssh is more than enough . i , however , would also like to connect to the graphical interface from time to time . at the moment i am using the built in vnc functionality but i am pretty sure this is neither the most efficient nor the most secure way of approaching this issue . i have done a bit of research on the issue but failed to come to any definite conclusions . i read about trying to forward the x environment over ssh , which would at least solve my security concerns . can anyone share their experiences in setting this up ? is there any other way that might be worth looking at ? i almost exclusively connect to this server from a windows machine . i do n't know if that might be a problem for some of the methods suggested .

631	starting a guest session from the login screen	i was wondering what is the best way to start the guest session from the login screen ( gdm ) . currently , i created a new user called 'ubuntu-guest ' ( has to be something other than 'guest ' ) . then added the following script to the startup applications . # ! /bin/bash /usr/share/gdm/guest-session/guest-session-launch & /usr/bin/gnome-session-save -- logout the problem with this method , is that when you log in as 'ubuntu-guest ' , you have to start up two gnome sessions : one for 'ubuntu-guest ' and one for the actual guest account . please let me know if you have any other better ideas . thanks !

647	parental controls with different settings for different users	does anyone know of a good way to set up some sort of parental controls so that one user account is subject to them , but not another ? a couple of friends of mine use ubuntu and have kids ( 7 to 10 years old ) who use the family computer . they 'd like to have some blocking of adult sites . they 're not going to supervise all the time , which i know might be ideal , but there we go . and they 're not particularly technical , so they do n't want to have to run scripts to turn the parental controls on and off regularly , but they can cope with having different accounts for different people . i have n't found a great way of doing this . i am pretty technical , so i 'm happy to spend some time at the command line to set it up , but then it needs to just work . please do n't just link to dansguardian . if your answer does n't address the different user account aspect , i will vote it down . if you want to talk about general parental controls that apply to all users then please start a new question - i 'm sure that plenty of people would be interested in it , and i 'll link to it from this question .

671	blurry fonts after upgrading to 10.04	recently i upgraded from 8.04 lts to 10.04 . the previous version had some problems regarding screen settings . x only recognised 1024x768 as resolution of my monitor , mainly because the monitor was not identified correct . with 10.04 the monitor and its resolutions are identified correct and the systems chooses a better resolution . but now the fonts seem blurry . they are hard to read . i tried a larger font size which improves the situation a bit . i also played around with nvidia-settings . if i choose 1024x768 again , the fonts look good . also some resolutions with specific refresh rates seem better . another try i made was to change hinting settings . however the best variant was already chosen . so i run out of ideas for a solution . do you have any hints ? my graphics card is nvidia corporation c68 [ geforce 7050 pv / nforce 630a ] ( rev a2 ) .

676	how do i set up ubuntu server 10.04 lts to serve as a samba primary domain controller uses pam modules to authenticate against an ldap server ?	i 'd like to have a samba server that appears as a primary domain controller ( pdc ) to a bunch of windows lab computers . but instead of having the users have accounts with passwords stored on this samba pdc , i 'd like to have all the account information stored on our functioning ldap server . so , when a user logs into a windows lab machine , they can do so with their ldap username and password . if i have to change their password , i just have to do it in the ldap server . the next time they log into this `` proxy pdc , '' they 'll be able to use their new ldap password . i have a functioning ldap server and a server that i can use to create the samba pdc . i 've played around with samba before , but i 've always had to have a local linux account for each user that i wanted to access samba and i had to create a corresponding samba account for each of those users . those are the steps that i 'd like to avoid if possible .

797	how can i make the fan in my computer turn off when it 's suspended ?	when my computer is suspended , the gpu , cpu and power supply fans all continue to run . i do n't think i 've ever been able to get them to turn off , short of hibernating or turning the computer off . i have some theories as to where to begin , but what i 'd like are some more solid ideas . i built this computer myself , so i think it 's possible that i did n't connect the fans to a proper power supply , so one theory is that i need to open the computer , and move the fan 's wire somewhere else on the motherboard . if this is correct , is there a way to know where to move it ? < -- this theory does n't make sense now that i realize it 's three different fans that keep running . my other theory is that i need to do something in my bios to make this change , and my third theory is that this is an ubuntu thing that i need to fix on the software side . does anybody know how to figure out why the fans never turn off , or what to do to fix them ? they do turn off when the computer is hibernating , but i do n't like doing that because it takes a very long time to boot up from hibernation .

823	choppy video playback	during the last couple of months i have had major problems playing high-definition videos in ubuntu . generally it 's 1080p videos that i have problems with , but i do recall having the same kind of problems with a 720p video a while back . this occurs on both my laptop ( with an integrated intel video chip ) and my desktop ( nvidia geforce 250gts ) . it 's strange , because i do n't think i 've had this problem in earlier versions of ubuntu , and it works fine in windows on the same machine ( s ) . the problems occur when trying to play a video that has been encoded to/with `` avc1 '' in an mkv container . i 'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to video codecs and such , but from what i 've read , avc1 seems like a pretty old codec . how come i have problems with that , when xvid works just fine ? suggestions on how to fix this problem ? edit : so i 've now tried all of the solutions proposed . none of them really worked , although some did lessen the choppiness . i even tried a 720p video using the same encoding , and that was also very choppy . could someone explain to me why this just will not work , when i can play back other 1080p videos flawlessly ?
829	debugging openoffice crashes	this is partly an openoffice question and partly a ubuntu question . i 'm running openoffice 3.2.0 and ubuntu 10.04 . i get frequent crashes of oo , especially the calc app , although i get crashes in the word processor as well . they are very abrupt and accompanies by no warning or error message . i 'm just typing away and then the app is gone . sometimes i even end up thinking i 'm typing in oo and discover that oo has crashed and i 'm typing in whatever application was under oo . however , i ca n't reproduce these crashes on demand . they seem random . i can open the same file and do the same exact thing but it does not crash . in ubuntu how do i trace , track , or diagnose these types of crashes ? is there software i can invoke to help diagnose ? can i start oo from a command prompt with debugging of some sort enabled ? note : if someone could add the tag openoffice , i would appreciate it

916	common desktop login via network ( like ad for windows )	one of the reasons we use windows in the office at work is active directory . it makes it a piece of cake to bring up a new workstation and have a new or existing user login and do their work . once all the applications are installed , a user can login on any workstation and have all their documents and settings available to them . is there any way of doing this on ubuntu ? sure , there are syncing programs like ubuntu one that sync the files ( and hopefully eventually settings ) , but as far as i am aware it still requires each workstation the user wishes to log onto to already have their user account set . also , any time a user changes their password it needs to be changed on each machine the user logs into . it would also be useful if this applied to servers as well , so a user can ssh into a server and have the same files as on their desktop in their home directory . does this sort of ability existing in ubuntu currently ?

1364	send osd notification messages to all systems on a network	what i 'm trying to do is send caller id ( cid ) information from a system running asterisk+freepbx to all ( 3 ) mythtv frontend systems on my network . i 'd like the cid information to pop-up over top of whatever is going on ( eg , whether it 's on a menu , or playing back a recording ) . eventually there may be other information as well , but for now cid would be a great start . the libnotify-style notifications are fine ( though i probably need to increase text size to make it visible ) . i was thinking something like growl , though this does n't seem to exist for linux . ideally i 'd just be able to do some kind of broadcast to the whole network , eg , from the freepbx system i could run a command like : notify -- broadcast -- title `` incoming call '' `` smith j\n613-555-1234 '' and then on any mythtv frontend , it would appear somewhere on screen . note : there is a mythnotify plugin , which i have used in a previous iteration of my setup , but it has a severe limitation ( i believe based on the way mythtv 's osd stuff works ) that it can only display notifications during video playback : not while in menus . i also remember it being a pain to get displaying properly : it uses xml for messaging then xslt to change to mythtv 's xml format . if you want to display something slightly differently , you have to make a small handful of new xml files and even then getting the `` callerid-from-phonebook.xml '' message to actually render to the ( remote ) `` callerid-from-phonebook-osd.xml '' file for display is some kind of black art .

1426	how to increase printers buffer while printing via command line ?	i have a epson stylus p50 usb printer and i need to print many copies ( 50~100 ) of some .prn files created via windows . i can not alter/convert those files ; they need to be printed exactly as they are . i installed the printer with cups and gutenprint drivers for epson r285 ( there is not much difference between the 2 printer models ) . my problem is that printing the prn with lp -d printer_name -n 100 /path/to/file.prn or lpr -p printer_name - # 100 /path/to/file.prn does not work as expected ; randomly the printer stops , in cups i got the error unable to write 9640 bytes on printer_name and the jobs queue happens to be cleared automatically . sometimes , the printer prints 1~2 copies before stopping , but often it stops with the first copy . i guess the problem is that ubuntu expects the printer buffer is bigger than it actually is ... but i really do not know . so , is there a way to increase the printer buffer , or to lower the buffer that ubuntu expects the printer to have ? edit : the error happens even giving just 1 copy .

1459	how can you monitor internet download usage ?	some broadband providers impose a monthly download limit , charging extra if you go over . it is also quite easy to exceed some of the lower limits just by installing/updating packages and 'normal ' browsing ( which to me includes streaming tv programs and movies ) . this means that you need to limit the amount you use the internet , yet it is hard to know when . the system monitor helps a bit with this by giving a total received/total sent in the networking section of the resources tab . however , this is reset every reboot . it would be good if there was a way to have a monthly total received so you can know how close you are to exceeding your limit and maybe even be given warnings if it looks like you are going to exceed the limits . does anyone know of a way to achieve this ?

1501	which flavor of ubuntu ?	this question has historical significance from the ask ubuntu beta . it is not considered a `` constructive '' question , as per the faq . my first question regarded a fresh install on my ubuntu box . some great answers . my housemate has a couple of sun ultra 20 's that are unused . so i made the best box possible using the better components of each . it 's sitting there just waiting to be loaded up with ubuntu . the new system may become my primary machine ; or maybe not ; and will probably be set up as a home server . also , almost certain to install lamp to use as a wordpress and drupal testing platform . at the moment i am undecided as to which version of ubuntu i want to use . the choice is between kubuntu , ubuntu , ubuntu studio , or ubuntu server ( with desktop added ) . kubuntu - basically just to try out and develop knowledge of kde . ubuntu studio - because i like the media tools for photography , video , etc . not sure that this one is even necessary since i can add whatever pkgs i want to ubuntu ubuntu - just because it 's familiar . ubuntu server - and add on a desktop since i 'm more of an artist by nature . my question is , what are the pros and cons of these options ? thanks in advance .
1502	how can i get the r backend for cantor in kubuntu ?	kubuntu can not build cantor with its r backend because r is in the universe repository while cantor ( source pacakge : kdeedu ) is in main , so cantor can not depend on r. is there any way to build my own cantor package that include the r backend ?

1528	bashrc or bash_profile ?	i know the difference between the two bash login scripts : .bashrc is run only by `` non-login '' shells . .bash_profile ( or .bash_login or .profile ) is executed by `` login '' shells . does anyone have some good examples of what things that are a better fit for login-only execution , such that i 'd only put them in .bash_profile , but they would n't really make sense in .bashrc ? ( i know most of us source .bashrc out of .bash_profile , so there does n't seem to be much point in the opposite question ... )

1541	is there any advantage to setting up a personal cloud instead of running a personal server without virtualization ?	i currently have my old pc sitting in my closet being a headless server ( running ubuntu server ) . i use it as a file server , web server , and backup server . ( the hostname is mneme , the greek muse of memory . ) are there any major reasons for me to consider replacing this non-virtualized setup with a personal cloud running on the same or similar hardware ? the major reason i can think of would be separation of services . for example , my backup system and my apache web server have nothing to do with each other directly , so they could run in separate instances . if i want to experiment with some new service ( e.g . set up a personal mail server ) , i could do it in a brand new instance and then later , after the inevitable miserable failure , i can just blow the whole mess away without affecting my other services . is this something that i could do with one or two computers running a personal cloud ? are there other advantages to setting up a personal cloud ?

1570	bigben wireless gamepad does not connect	the gamepad is more or less a clone of a xbox controller ( iirc it is even from the same manufacturer ) , labeled pcpadrflx . lsusb lists the receiver as id 1a34:0801. dmesg | grep input reads [ 6880.468415 ] input : acrux rf usb gamepad 8206 as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:10.1/usb2/2-2/2-2.3/2-2.3:1.0/input/input17 unfortunately , while the receiver is recognized , the gamepad itself does not connect . usually after pressing a button on it the led would light up once to indicate it has connected , however it just blinks as it does when no receiver is connected at all . so , how can i make the gamepad work ?

1577	moving from bash to zsh	i 'm considering moving from bash to zsh as i often come across posts praising zsh . i 'm an experienced command line user and i 'm assuming the basics are pretty much the same , so i 'm looking for advice to get the benefits of moving , and any gotchas to be aware of . please just give one bit of advice per answer . i 'm looking for bite-size chunks where i can come back and integrate extra bits of info into my shell usage at a steady pace rather than trying to learn it all in one go .
1583	technically speaking , what is different about ubuntu compared to other linux distributions ?	this is a question that 's puzzled me for quite a while ( and refers to the differences between all distributions ) . in my mind , a distribution is : a pre-configured os , with some pre-installed packages , some created by the distribution 's community that are unique to that distribution ( e.g . apt-get ) . i 'm not sure my definition is right as i feel there 's something else . i 'm really interested in setting up my own archlinux distro ( which starts as a very minimal barebones system that you expand yourself ) but feel i need to understand this first .
1596	nasty cpu spikes that are n't connected to any visible processes	really strange issue here . i intermittently keep getting really unpleasant cpu spikes , where the cpu gets to 80-90 % busy across all cores for about 5 minutes . when i look at conky , in htop or system monitor , and sort by % cpu , i ca n't see any process that accounts for this much cpu usage . the only things i 've changed since this started are : i moved to kernel version 2.6.35 ( home compiled , up from 2.6.24-1 ) i installed the nvidia driver 256.44 ( up from 256.34 ) now , i am willing to downgrade either/both of those to find the problem but i 'd prefer to do this as scientifically as possible and find out what is causing the cpu explosion before i downgrade . edit : my precise issue looks like a nvidia regression in their latest driver . other people are getting similar spikes .

1603	wine users configuration	i 'm rebuilding an ubuntu system and this is a problem that i had on my original installation . the issue is this : in my home account i installed apps into wine and all is good . however , i have a second account that i use for work purposes . so , i open wine in the second account and it turns out that my home account wine apps are not installed . so , basically i had to install the apps into the second user account as well . this is really inefficient since it 's about 600mb worth of apps . ( at the time i was new to linux and did n't have time to do this properly . ) anyway , since i 'm essentially starting over , what i 'd like to do is have wine apps installed and available to multi users . the question : how do i make wine apps available to multiple users ? thanks .

1626	how can i run dwarf fortress in text mode ( ncurses ) on my linux vps ?	i installed dwarf fortress on my linux vps to use with dfterm . it 's running ubuntu 10.04 server x86-32 . i 'm fairly certain i have all the dependencies : i 've installed : ncurses ncursesw libsdl libsdl-image libgtk libglu libopenal1 i had to turn sound off or it will instantly segfault , and i set the display mode to text . i 've made no other changes to the config . however , even before i go near dfterm , it wo n't run properly . it just displays a blank screen . what could be causing this ? is there a dependency i missed ? is there something else i should have changed in the config ? given that it is a server , there is a good chance that if there is a missing dependency , it 's something that the devs went `` sure , everyone has that '' and did n't bother to list . other ncurses applications ( vim , irssi use it , i think ? ) work fine .

1662	the best way to compile a kernel for an i7 processor ?	i have compiled my own kernels for a while now . i started when i got my i7 processor and wanted its turbo boost to work properly . i 've since bought an ssd so continue to benefit from a more recent kernel than the repo version . with my most recent builds , i 've started getting weird cpu spikes . while it could be a number of different things causing this , i 'd like to focus on getting the kernel `` right '' and if possible , more optimised than ever . i follow the `` old-fashioned debian '' on the kernel/compile wiki . i do this because i 'm building from a direct download from kernel.org . first questions : should i get my source from somewhere else and should i use a different build method ? the guide suggests getting the current .config like so : cp -vi /boot/config- ` uname -r ` .config this is all well and good if your current configuration works well but i 'm concerned mine contains a problem ... second question : is there a good ubuntu-friendly , i7-friendly default .config file i can download from somewhere ? there are a lot of kernel patches floating around at the moment . some promise a more responsive system through patching io bugs , some give `` better '' schedulers ( bfs , et al ) but it 's hard to find decent benchmarks to see if these are worthwhile features of if they 're just unstable junk . third : are there any patches you would apply to 2.6.35 to make it more compatible with lucid ? i fear it 's make menuconfig where i screw things up . i try to turn off drivers i do n't need and select options that look like they 'll optimise things but , truth be told , i 'm not a kernel developer ; i do n't know for certain if an option will break everything or even help at all . fourth : how would you optimise the .config/build-process for an i7 and ssd ?

1691	is there an easy way to edit gtk-recordmydesktop videos ?	gtk-recordmydesktop outputs .ogv files that seem perfectly fine - they work well in totem and vlc . however , if i try to edit them in openshot or kdenlive , the editor either crashes ( kdenlive ) or wo n't show the video properly ( openshot ) . pitivi appears to work but then locks up when it tries to render the video . using video conversion tools , such as ffmpeg outputs a video that is a jumble of colours ; although it is just about possible to make out some movement . the only way i 've managed to edit the videos is to use devede to create a dvd .iso , mount the iso and then edit the .vob file ( s ) . this is a bit of a faff ; does anyone know of a better way around this ?

1697	debugging/monitoring emacs	i 'm using gnu emacs 23.1.50.1 ( x86_64-pc-linux-gnu , gtk+ version 2.18.0 ) and start my emacs session inside gnu screen . since i upgraded to ubuntu 10.04 and the version of emacs-snapshot there i encounter some problems . sometimes emacs hogs all ram plus the same amount of swap space ( 2+2gb ) and also eats all cpu time . when i send the process a sigterm the process stops to eat cpu time , but the huge allocated amount of memory stays . emacs itself does n't take any key sequences . so usually i send the process a sigkill and it dies . now i want to find out where the bug ( if there is one ) is located and want to do some debugging . i can see no special reason for this behavior . sometimes it starts after emacs is freshly started , sometimes i can work a whole day without problems , sometimes it happens in between . so i 'm looking for a kind of debugging or monitoring the process . i tried strace , but this generates too much output . strace output of a editing session should easily fill my whole harddrive . running emacs inside gdb should also not work , because if i remember correctly ubuntu builds the software without debugging symbols . so do you have any advice how i can find the ( possible ) bug ? what would you suggest ?

1712	why would the aptitude binary be missing if its package is installed ?	yesterday i upgraded a laptop from kubuntu 9.04 ( lucid ) to 9.10 ( karmic ) . then afterwards i tried to install some software $ sudo aptitude install dont-remember-what-it-was and i get sudo : aptitude : command not found wait , what ? how can aptitude be missing ? and it 's not just that - apt-get and dpkg also somehow mysteriously vanished from the system . i 've manually checked in /usr/bin and all the other directories in $ path and verified that the files actually do not exist . $ ls /usr/bin/aptitude ls : can not access /usr/bin/aptitude : no such file or directory thankfully i have two graphical package managers available , adept installer and kpackagekit . both of them report that the aptitude package is installed . i tried uninstalling and reinstalling it through the gui , just to be safe , and the uninstall/reinstall seemed to go off without a hitch . but the actual program binaries are still missing . is this something normal ? if not , has anyone ever heard of it happening ? is it likely that the missing programs will magically reappear if i upgrade to 10.04 ? edit : i have no idea what was going on , but after leaving the computer off overnight and a couple of reboots , the problem seems to have fixed itself . all the right files seem to be there .

1722	basic ubuntu ftp server	i would like to setup a basic ftp server on my ubuntu server install . i have been playing with vsftpd , but am having issues getting the server to allow me to create directories and copy files . i have set the system to allow local users , but it appears that does n't mean i get access to create directories . this may be an instance where i need to be better grounded in ubuntu server setup in order to configure this ftp server adequately . the end goal is to be able to move files from my local dev folder into my www folder for deployment . directories need to be able to move as well . any help would be greatly appreciated .

1743	is aptitude still considered superior to apt-get ?	when i first started with ubuntu using aptitude was the 'in-thing ' , with some stated improvements over apt-get . am i correct in saying that apt-get has now 'caught up ' with aptitude , and it makes little difference which is used ( although it is preferable to choose one or the other , and stick with it ) ? moreover , with aptitude set to be removed from a default ubuntu install , should everyone revert to apt-get , especially when guiding new users interested in the cli ?

1766	lost lxde menus after replacing /home	i am trying lubuntu on an old laptop . i have before and after the install i had two partitions ( +swap ) mounting on / and on /home . when i did the lubuntu install i told it to ignore the /home partition . after the lubuntu install i logged in and everything appeared ok . i mounted the /home partition as /hold.old . then i copied all the files from /home to /home.old . then for each user i chown'ed the stuff in /home.old . then i edited /etc/fstab to mount the /home partition . then i renamed /home . then i rebooted . all my old files are where i expected them in the /home filesystem . but my lxde menu system is messed up . instead of the full menu system i only have terminal and logout . i thought that most of the menu system lived in /usr/share . but , apparently lxde has some menu stuff in /home that i did not get copied over correctly . is there a quick way to restore the default lxde menu system ? can you point some documentation that would be good for learning the sysadmin level workings of lxde ?

1786	what is the difference between network manager and 'ifconfig ' 'ifup ' , etc ?	ubuntu seems to provide at least two network `` toolsets '' ( for lack of a better term ) . i 'm running into conflicts between these two . network manager something which is more like the traditional network tools ( e.g . ifconfig , 'ifup ' , /etc/network/interfaces i am often running into conflicts between these different sets of tools . for example , i 'm running ubuntu desktop at home and i 'm using software like kvm/libvirt which recommends that i disable network manager , but disabling network manager causes other things to break . what is the difference between network manager and the traditional network tools ? can these two suites run side-by-side or must i stick with one or the other ? is there a document which summarizes the difference between these different tools ? i have been unable to find one . ( forgive the vagueness of this question . i 've searched and searched for an answer , but i have only found many vague answers which do n't seem relevant to ubuntu 10.04/lucid , and i may not fully understand the purpose of networkmanager . however , this seems to be a frequently asked question . if you have advice for clarifying this question , please post a comment . )

1807	how can i strip down ubuntu ?	i 'm trying to fix what i consider a bloated install of ubuntu . when i install ubuntu on a machine , i get things that i do n't want - web browsers , office applications , media players , accessibility utilities , ubuntu one , and so on . my goal is to create a way that i can have an install of ubuntu that contains only the most minimal packages - the administrative tools and package manager , a gui ( my preference would be gnome ) , a text editor , core drivers ( video cards , network cards - wired and wireless , input devices ) , and anything else that i have to have to run a stable distribution . from there , i would like to pick and choose which packages i install to create my own customized system . after playing around with other distros like arch and slackware , like how they provide a barebones install by default . however , i get trapped in a `` configuration hell '' - right now , i tried moving away from ubuntu and to arch , but after spending 6 hours with it , i still do n't have a usable system . it 's half configured and i do n't have any usable software packages to enable me to work . is anything that can help me available ? either something like the opensuse builder that lets you choose applications and packages for the cd , an advanced installation mode where i can choose the packages to install and which to ignore , or a guide on how to strip ubuntu down to its bare bones ? and i suppose a natural follow up to this is once i have a stripped down ubuntu , will this affect updating at all ? when canonical releases the next version of ubuntu , i do n't want any bloatware reinstalled . and yes , most of the applications that come with ubuntu , i simply do n't use . ever .

1816	how to get more people involved in improving x.org for ubuntu ?	in ubuntu , x is one of the more critical pieces in the stack . as such , we get a ton of questions and bug reports about it , probably about 100 times as many as we have manpower to handle . canonical is hiring additional engineers to work on x which will help , but still there are many things that are outside the scope of what canonical can do , so i feel it is really important to have a strong community involved in improving x in ubuntu , particularly around getting all these massive amounts of bug reports answered , triaged , and ( hopefully ) solved . however , it 's tough to find people to work on x or to convince people that it is worthwhile for them to invest their time in it . how would you suggest going about encouraging people to get involved , who might not otherwise be thinking of working on x ?

1830	will plymouth allow for a nice boot experience with proprietary graphics drivers in future ?	the new graphical bootloader introduced in 10.04 ( plymouth ) looks amazing until i enable proprietary drivers for my video card . i then get a horrible flashy monster of a boot experience , which i can cope with if i have to , but i 'm sure would be offputting for newer users . my understanding is that plymouth depends on features that currently are n't available in the proprietary drivers . my question is , is this likely to change , or should i just get used to 'one or the other ' ( i.e . a nice boot experience or a nice desktop experience , but not both ) ? can we expect to see plymouth playing nice with proprietary graphics drivers in future , or is this solely reliant on work from the proprietary manufacturers ?

2071	dropbox reconnect on network connection established	i am running unr ( but using the regular gnome launcher ) and have dropbox installed . since i use my laptop on the train , there is no network connectivity . however once i reconnect to a network , dropbox seems to be completely unresponsive to the fact that there is a network connection and has to be restarted ( which means lots of hard drive scanning , battery usage , slowdowns , etc ) . is there a way to get dropbox to reconnect automatically , or gota wait for a patch ? edit : nothing special about my network configuration , pretty much out-of-the-box . note that most of the time i connect to wifi not cable . but the problem does not change in either case . and i forgot to mention , i usually put my computer to sleep/hibernate in between leaving home and using it on the train so it `` loses '' or `` gains '' connection on waking up . more edit : i just had the problem happening again . basically it has a network cable plugged in . goes to sleep . on wakeup ( cable still plugged in ) dropbox is stuck at `` connecting '' .
2073	firefox slow performance	i have to say , firefox on ubuntu 's performance is attrocious . very quickly it gets into 100 % cpu use ( thank god i have multiple cores ) and hundreds of megs of ram . even closing tabs does not help the issue ( unless google.com uses supreme amounts of javascript ) . on the same machine chromium browser runs lightning smooth . i tried swiftfox , nothing useful there . is this a common problem ? only recent ( past 3.6 ) versions have even been able to scroll rather smoothly vs choppy performance when using the scroll bar on pages . the performance is getting close to running firefox on a windows xp virtual box vm . edit : os : kubuntu 9.10 . installed gnome packages for ubuntu and use those . upgraded to 10.04 . 64bit nvidia proprietary video drivers using the restricted driver tool . hardware : core 2 quad 4gb ddr2 667 ram 7200rpm hdd nvidia geforce 8800 also note for everyone responding : the default settings work damn well in windows on the same machine . the performance in linux is what sucks .

2126	why does the mount point keeps changing , and how can i prevent it ?	when i plug in an external usb drive , it automatically mounts and it 's accesible in /media/disk/ however after a while , this is how my /media directory looks like : cesar @ minas-tirith : ~ $ ls /media/ 0bc7-569e 0bc7-569e_ disk disk_ disk__ disk___ as you can see , the disk entry is repeated with additional _ appended at the end . i do n't know why this happens , but i can imagine that under some circumstances , the system ca n't mount the disk in /media/disk/ and creates disk_ , then it ca n't mount it in /media/disk_ and creates disk__ and so forth . the other entry 0bc7-569e i think it 's from a sd media card so it 's not only for usb drives . i would like to know what is causing this ? is this expected behavior ? or how can i prevent this from happening ?

2145	how can i use pulseaudio over ssh ?	i 'd like to listen to music on my home server from work . both are ubuntu boxes running pulseaudio . it seems from researching that applications communicate to the pa server via tcp on port 4317 , so i figured it should be as easy as : me @ work : ssh -yr 4317 : localhost:4317 me @ home at this point i can run rhythmbox from the ssh session with x11 forwarding , and i assumed rhythmbox would be transparently talking to pulseaudio over the reverse tunnel , resulting in the music playing on my work machine . however instead it appears that the music still plays on my home computer . i 've tried messing around with pulse_server as well to no avail . has anyone accomplished something similar ? it seems like this should be relatively simple due to pulseaudio 's design . i 've played around with mounting my music library via sshfs instead but i 'd really like to have one set of metadata/app settings/playlists and such . thanks for any tips !
2146	how can i boot from a 16 gb pendrive with some old bios ?	i need to boot ubuntu in a computer ( computer a ) with no cd . i have a 16 gb pendrive with a live ubuntu version . the pendrive works in at least two newer computers . computer a boots from a 2gb pendrive right . so it 's likely a bios issue . but it 's quite inconvenient to always carry two pendrives , how can i made the older computer boot from the bigger drive ? . notes : repartitioning the drive does n't seen to work . i noticed than the 16 gb pendrive is seen like a external zip drive by the bios , while the smaller one is seen as a hard disk . likely related .

2150	accessing a specific url with firefox 3.6 on ubuntu 10.4 crashed the os , how should i debug this ?	the system is a spare dell 2400 i wiped clean , with ubuntu 10.4 installed . update manager has everything current , and i have n't been mucking with drivers or tricky system settings . in fact , it has been a stable and friendly system to install and use . so imagine my surprise when browsing to http : //element-14.com/ ( an otherwise useful community site for electronic engineering types ) followed a redirect or two , then black screen , then the i 'm starting up tune with the pink hazy smoke and nothing further works . the keyboard is crashed hard , and the alt-sysrq key combos do nothing . more than just firefox and the x server are crashing . i repeated the crash with an ssh session open , and not only did the connection get taken down , but it no longer responded to attempts to get a fresh connection . i tried enabling apport , in hopes that it would notice something and help identify the culprit , but it seems to be oblivious to the crash . each time , i 've had to lean on the power button to reboot . google searches hint that there are issues with the particular intel chipset providing the vga on its motherboard . i 'm looking for advice about how to proceed with debugging this kind of crash . any ideas ? update : i tried following advice to try setting up the netconsole kernel module and a matching netcat instance to receive the log . i set up netcat on my xp box , used alt-sysrq-s to verify it could receive kernel messages , then browsed to the site . only two printk ( ) s were logged : [ 251728.009794 ] i915 : unknown parameter ` modset' [ 251728.051420 ] i915 : unknown parameter ` modset' hmm . perhaps my video driver is misconfigured ? especially since i see these same messages in the output of dmesg just after booting . at least this time i explicitly synced my disks before deliberately crashing the system . for the record , lspci -nn | grep vga says : 00:02.0 vga compatible controller [ 0300 ] : intel corporation 82845g/gl [ brookdale-g ] /ge chipset integrated graphics device [ 8086:2562 ] ( rev 01 ) update : solved ! ! ! the hint to use netconsole led to an epiphany . googling around the phrase `` i915 unknown parameter modset '' suddenly led me to trip over the root cause . the name of the option to the i915 driver is modeset not modset . i changed /etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf to have the correct spelling , rebooted , and now i can access element-14 ( and presumably other sites that do whatever it is that element-14 does that triggers the bug in the video driver ) without an unpleasant forced reboot . this leaves behind the ( apparently well known ) issue that the i915 driver lacks quality , especially on older chipsets . apparently the kernel mode setting feature is particularly deficient . without the option spelled correctly , it defaulted to kms enabled , and also crashed . with it spelled correctly , kms is disabled , and the driver survives whatever content was triggering the crash . also , there are a number of bug pages at launchpad and other community sites that have the wrong spelling of the option name . i strongly suspect that is where i got the spelling i used . edit : i 've copied the relevant solution to an actual answer , and improved my description of it here .

2194	how can i improve overall system performance ?	what are your tips for improving overall system performance on ubuntu ? inspired by this question i realized that some default settings may be rather conservative on ubuntu and that it 's possible to tweak it with little or no risk if you wish to make it faster . this is not meant to be application specific ( e.g . make firefox load pages faster ) , but system wide . preferably 1 tip per answer , with enough detail for people to implement it . a couple of mine would be : install preload ( via software center or sudo apt-get install preload ) ; change swappiness value - `` which controls the degree to which the kernel prefers to swap when it tries to free memory '' ; what are yours ? ps : since this is not intended to have a unique answer but rather , several useful tips , i 'm making this community wiki out-of-the-box .

2258	keyboard/mouse not recognised during installation	i have a logitech mx5000 keyboard/mouse combo . i 'm using the logitech bluetooth dongle , and i use it in usb emulation mode ( not native bluetooth ) . i tried to install ubuntu 10.04 using wubi . after the ubuntu setup started natively , the keyboard and mouse refuse to work . i have no other keyboards or mice around . i tried unplugging and re-plugging the usb dongle to make sure it 's in usb mode and not bluetooth , but when i do that the keyboard refuses to re-pair with the dongle ( using the connect buttons ) . rebooting into windows 7 and the keyboard/mouse instantly come back . any ideas how i can get ubuntu 10.04 installed ?
2261	how are administrators supposed to read root 's mail ?	what is the ubuntu way for system administrators to receive system notifications , which typically take the form of e-mail sent to the root account ? examples of such notifications are the output of cron jobs , or degraded raid notifications . on a pretty much default ubuntu 10.04 installation , i ca n't find any way that anything happens to root 's mail other than being deposited in /var/mail/root . how are users supposed to 1. discover it and 2. read it as it arrives ? i observe that on a warty , the installer added root : myusername to /etc/aliases . so back then the user who installed the system if ( s ) he read the local mail . so there seems to have been a regression somewhere along the way . still this was not a complete solution , because ubuntu users ca n't be expected to be aware that they have local mail and should set up their mail client to read it . added : given current replies , a server user should be able to cope , provided he 's aware of the issue . fair enough . but consider j . random desktop user , who does n't know how to use a command line , and only knows how to click the mailbox icon to read his mail . how can he be notified that his system wants to tell him something ? ( allow a one-time intervention by a more competent user if that 's unavoidable . )

2280	selective mounted volumes for the gnome desktop and nautilus sidebar	by default 'mounted volumes ' are shown on the ubuntu desktop . i usually disable this ( gconf-editor or ubuntu tweak ) because i do n't want , for instance , my windows partition on the desktop . however this would be a useful to display usb flash data sticks or memory cards , which are not permanently mounted volumes . so is there some way to be selective about which volumes are shown on the desktop ?

2294	how to fix a package manager error in notification area after upgrading a fresh install of lucid with a '/home ' from jaunty ?	i just installed 10.04 , and used manual partitioning to preserve my '/home ' from a 9.04 install . ( to be clear : i did not upgraded 9.04 to 10.04 , but installed 10.04 off a of cd , keeping only my '/home ' . ) after the sucessful 10.04 install , i used synaptic to apply all updates , rebooted , removed some packages ( mostly tomboy and bluetooth ) , rebooted , and then used synaptic to install tonnes of packages , mostly from lucid/main and lucid-updates/main , though i also did install a number from lucid/universe and lucid-updates/universe . a minute or so after the mass installation of new packages , a red circular icon with a white bar running horizontally through it appeared in my notification area . ( the icon is quite like the `` do not enter this road '' sign pictured here . ) on hovering my mouse over the icon , i get the following message : an error occurred , please run package manager from the right-click menu or apt-get in a terminal to see what is wrong . the error message was : 'unknown error : `` ( e : opening configuration file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99synaptic - ifstream : :ifstream ( 13 : permission denied ) ) ' this usually means that your installed packages have unmet dependencies ( since there was no way to copy the text , i transcribed it ; it is n't impossible that it is not a completely faithful transcription . ) i then ran the following commands : sudo apt-get check sudo apt-get clean sudo apt-get autoclean sudo apt-get autoremove and then ran those same commands ( in that order ) but also with the -f flag . i then rebooted . this has n't removed the warning icon from the notification area . so , i am at a loss for how to proceed . [ snip a lot of detail about what packages i 'd installed and removed that turned out not to be relevant at all . ]
2299	simple twitter client to post all text entry	this is a bit of a weird question , and i do n't even know if it belongs here or not . i want to set up a ubuntu box with a keyboard and a twitter program , so that everything that is typed into the keyboard is posted on twitter . so what i am looking for is a simple twitter client that will force all input via keyboard into a tweet and post to twitter after 140 chars , after the enter key , and/or a time period . basically what i am planning is a little experiment to leave a keyboard somewhere it can be typed on and played with , and post all text entry through to twitter automatically . the alternative is to simply save all entered text to a file , but i would prefer the twitter approach . does anyone have any ideas if there is a program/script out there that will do this for me ? i am mainly looking for a command line script , as gui programs are easier to exit or lose focus than a command line .

2314	guest resizing ubuntu 10.04 64-bit in vmware player not working	background i 'm running ubuntu as a guest os in a vm . originally the vm was created with ubuntu 9.10 64-bit and with vmware-tools installed , when i resized or maximized the vmware player , the guest os was correctly and automatically resized . once i upgraded to ubuntu 10.04 ( not reinstalled ) , automatic resizing no longer works . however , the mouse and network drivers do continue to operate properly . when installing vmware-tools in 10.04 , i notice a lot of lsb warnings for upstart jobs that were not thrown when installing it in 9.10 . environment distro : ubuntu 10.04 64-bit kernel : linux nitrogen 2.6.32-24-generic # 39-ubuntu smp wed jul 28 05:14:15 utc 2010 x86_64 gnu/linux vmware player : 3.0.1 build-227600 host os : windows 7 home 64-bit what i 've already tried : reinstalling vmware-tools updating to the latest patch level of vmware player 3.0.1 updating all installed ubuntu packages , including kernel ( and then re-install vmware-tools ) manually creating entries in xorg.conf for the host 's fullscreen resolution problem when i resize or maximize the vmware player window , the guest os size stays fixed . question how do you configure vmware-tools for vmware player 3.0.1 in ubuntu 10.04 64-bit to enable automatic guest resizing ? update i do n't know exactly why this fixed my issue , but on aug 28th , 2010 a set of package updates came out that ( see below ) , after installation , magically resolved this issue . i 'm guessing it has something to do with the xorg packages . start-date : 2010-08-28 08:05:49 install : ttf-dejavu-extra ( 2.30-2 ) upgrade : libsmbclient ( 3.4.7~dfsg-1ubuntu3 , 3.4.7~dfsg-1ubuntu3.1 ) , language-pack-gnome-en-base ( 10.04+20100422 , 10.04+20100714 ) , libkpathsea5 ( 2009-5ubuntu0.1 , 2009-5ubuntu0.2 ) , smbclient ( 3.4.7~dfsg-1ubuntu3 , 3.4.7~dfsg-1ubuntu3.1 ) , linux-image-2.6.32-24-generic ( 2.6.32-24.39 , 2.6.32-24.41 ) , ubufox ( 0.9~rc2-0ubuntu2 , 0.9~rc2-0ubuntu2.1 ) , language-pack-gnome-en ( 10.04+20100422 , 10.04+20100714 ) , xserver-xorg-core ( 1.7.6-2ubuntu7.2 , 1.7.6-2ubuntu7.3 ) , ghostscript-cups ( 8.71.dfsg.1-0ubuntu5.2 , 8.71.dfsg.1-0ubuntu5.3 ) , xserver-common ( 1.7.6-2ubuntu7.2 , 1.7.6-2ubuntu7.3 ) , libwbclient0 ( 3.4.7~dfsg-1ubuntu3 , 3.4.7~dfsg-1ubuntu3.1 ) , icedtea-6-jre-cacao ( 6b18-1.8-4ubuntu3 , 6b18-1.8.1-0ubuntu1 ) , linux-headers-2.6.32-24-generic ( 2.6.32-24.39 , 2.6.32-24.41 ) , openjdk-6-jre-lib ( 6b18-1.8-4ubuntu3 , 6b18-1.8.1-0ubuntu1 ) , libfreetype6 ( 2.3.11-1ubuntu2.1 , 2.3.11-1ubuntu2.2 ) , openjdk-6-jre-headless ( 6b18-1.8-4ubuntu3 , 6b18-1.8.1-0ubuntu1 ) , samba-common ( 3.4.7~dfsg-1ubuntu3 , 3.4.7~dfsg-1ubuntu3.1 ) , linux-headers-2.6.32-24 ( 2.6.32-24.39 , 2.6.32-24.41 ) , ifupdown ( 0.6.8ubuntu29 , 0.6.8ubuntu29.1 ) , tzdata-java ( 2010k-0ubuntu0.10.04 , 2010l-0ubuntu0.10.04 ) , libdjvulibre21 ( 3.5.22-1ubuntu4 , 3.5.22-1ubuntu4.1 ) , ghostscript-x ( 8.71.dfsg.1-0ubuntu5.2 , 8.71.dfsg.1-0ubuntu5.3 ) , libservlet2.5-java ( 6.0.24-2ubuntu1.2 , 6.0.24-2ubuntu1.3 ) , libgs8 ( 8.71.dfsg.1-0ubuntu5.2 , 8.71.dfsg.1-0ubuntu5.3 ) , tzdata ( 2010k-0ubuntu0.10.04 , 2010l-0ubuntu0.10.04 ) , ghostscript ( 8.71.dfsg.1-0ubuntu5.2 , 8.71.dfsg.1-0ubuntu5.3 ) , google-chrome-beta ( 6.0.472.33-r55501 , 6.0.472.51-r57639 ) , linux-libc-dev ( 2.6.32-24.39 , 2.6.32-24.41 ) , samba-common-bin ( 3.4.7~dfsg-1ubuntu3 , 3.4.7~dfsg-1ubuntu3.1 ) , upstart ( 0.6.5-6 , 0.6.5-7 ) , libdjvulibre-text ( 3.5.22-1ubuntu4 , 3.5.22-1ubuntu4.1 ) , language-pack-en-base ( 10.04+20100422 , 10.04+20100714 ) , binutils ( 2.20.1-3ubuntu6 , 2.20.1-3ubuntu7 ) , openjdk-6-jre ( 6b18-1.8-4ubuntu3 , 6b18-1.8.1-0ubuntu1 ) , language-pack-en ( 10.04+20100422 , 10.04+20100714 ) end-date : 2010-08-28 08:09:25

2317	ureadahead seems to block the system on boot	i had a look at my bootcharts and something seems to be wrong with them . the ureadahead process does what it 's supposed to do ( disk utilisation is 100 % most of the time ) , but it also blocks any other action . since i 've got a slow , laptop harddrive , ureadahead itself takes ~50s of the boot time . then , the rest of the visible boot sequence takes another 100s to complete , using a lot of cpu , but not maxing it out and lots of io ( again , 100 % almost all the time ) . this seems just strange to me . is my ureadahead misconfigured ? why does it block tasks like bringing up the network which seems to be taking lots of cpu ? should it take ~50 % of the bootchart time in general ? edit : here is the example bootchart : http : //img191.imageshack.us/img191/1049/localhostkarmic20100815.png ( or this if the direct one did n't work : http : //yfrog.com/f/5blocalhostkarmic20100815p/ )

2405	nautilus does n't show my desktop until i kill it	something 's wrong with nautilus . when i boot my computer and it logs in , gnome shows , things are running , i can run programs and everything , but my desktop has no icons . i have to open a terminal and run killall nautilus and then suddenly everything works fine . how can i diagnose and fix this ? or , as a last resort , how might i create a script that runs at startup to automatically kill and restart nautilus ?

2411	how do i find out which process is eating up my bandwidth ?	i think i 'm being the victim of a bug here . sometimes while i 'm working ( i still do n't know why ) , my network traffic goes up to 200 kb/s and stays that way , even tough i 'm not doing anything internet-related . this sometimes happens to me with the cpu usage . when it does , i just run a top command to find out which process is responsible and then kill it . problem is : i have no way of knowing which process is responsible for my high network usage . both the resource monitor and the top command only tell me my total network usage , neither of them tells me process specific network info . i 've found questions here about monitoring total bandwidth usage , but , as i mentioned , that 's not what i need . is there another command i can use to find out which process is getting out of hand ? the command iftop gives results that disagree entirely with the information reported by system monitor . while the latter claims there 's high network traffic , the former claims there 's barely 1 kb/s . i 've already tried killing all the obvious ones ( firefox , update-manager , pidgin , etc ) with no luck . so far , restarting the machine is the only way i found of getting rid of the issue .

2470	clock stops ticking when inactive , causing drift	the clock applet drifts in time . clock is set to `` synchronize with internet ... '' so it is correct at startup , but then if i stay inactive for some time , may be 5 min as well as 1 hour , the clock stops ticking . if i start to be active again , then the clock applet moves again , but the time is now late . and it is not only the applet that is wrong , but the whole system date , because when i run date in a terminal , the time is also wrong . clarification : sorry , may be my question was not clear . here is my bug report to ubuntu : expected behaviour : clock-applet displays the correct time , observed behaviour : displayed time is drifting how to reproduce : if i get away from my computer for some times , the time displayed by the clock applet drifts . but the date command also show the wrong time . moreover , sleep interval also get wrong . to debug this , i tested the following script : # ! /bin/bash while [ [ true ] ] do date > > clocktest.log hwclock > > clocktest.log sleep 300 done must be run as root because of hwclock . il launched it : ./clocktest.sh & and got away from my computer here is the output log : 1 mardi 17 août 2010 , 12:42:12 ( utc+0200 ) 2 mar . 17 août 2010 12:42:13 cest -0.346882 secondes 3 mardi 17 août 2010 , 12:47:13 ( utc+0200 ) 4 mar . 17 août 2010 12:57:13 cest -0.080965 secondes 5 mardi 17 août 2010 , 12:52:13 ( utc+0200 ) 6 mar . 17 août 2010 13:02:14 cest -1.002776 secondes 7 mardi 17 août 2010 , 12:57:18 ( utc+0200 ) 8 mar . 17 août 2010 13:07:18 cest -0.063633 secondes 9 mardi 17 août 2010 , 13:02:18 ( utc+0200 ) 10 mar . 17 août 2010 13:12:19 cest -0.361501 secondes 11 mardi 17 août 2010 , 13:07:19 ( utc+0200 ) 12 mar . 17 août 2010 13:17:20 cest -0.987434 secondes line 1 and 2 show the first time through the loop . line 3 and 4 show the bug : while date ( and sleep ) thinks 5 minutes have elapsed , hwclock shows that 15 minutes have elapsed . line 5 to 12 shows normal behaviour , except now date is late by 10 minutes . behaviour is normal because i was back at my desk using the computer . having clock applet displaying the wrong time is one thing , but having the whole system time wrong ( since sleep gets confused too ) is a major bug . hardware : it is a fujitsu siemens amilo xi 2550 notebook . it was working fine with ubuntu 8.04

2622	blank screen , blinking cursor on boot	occasionally my ubuntu 10.04 pc wo n't boot properly . it gets past grub and then stops at a blank screen and blinking cursor . from what i 've read , this blinking cursor screen is presented by ubuntu itself and not grub , so i assume the boot process gets halted for some reason . has anyone any guidance on how to diagnose this issue or what the cause is likely to be ? normally i need to press the reset button to reboot the pc and often it will reboot fine . the fact that it is intermittent is what confuses me . any pointers on diagnosing the problem would be much appreciated . edit : it 's been a while , mainly because my server has been up for a long time . it looks like i 've captured a recurrence of this issue , i copied the messages file and the dmesg file and had a look where processing seems to have stopped and found the messages below . i 'm going to do some research on google etc . but figured i 'd put it up here in case anyone can help and wants to earn themselves some points . i should mention that the ondemand governor failed message happens on successful boots but the other two do n't appear to . oct 11 23:17:21 linux kernel : [ 98.905370 ] ondemand governor failed , too long transition latency of hw , fallback to performance governor oct 11 23:21:48 linux kernel : kernel logging ( proc ) stopped . oct 11 23:21:48 linux rsyslogd : [ origin software= '' rsyslogd '' swversion= '' 4.2.0 '' x-pid= '' 697 '' x-info= '' http : //www.rsyslog.com '' ] exiting on signal 15 . i found a few vague references to rolling over of logfiles at boot time being the cause

2786	what is the relationship between ubuntu single sign on and launchpad login service ?	canonical operates at least two openid based login services within the ubuntu online world : ubuntu single sign on and the launchpad login service . according to the information in the footer of both sites they share the same backing software which is called canonical sso provider . my question is whether these two sites are entirely separate implementations or do they share the same user database ? alternatively , is there some other less direct relationship between the two services ? in other words , if i did n't have an account with either service and i created a new account with ubuntu single sign on would i then also have a launchpad login service account ? what about the inverse scenario ? i know that the launchpad login service existed earlier than ubuntu single sign on . i also know that i was able to use my existing launchpad login details with the ubuntu sso when it was launched . however , i 've never been clear if these are the same account or if my launchpad account was copied to the newer service and they are now separate .

2807	moving application windows from one workspace to another by dragging in the workspace chooser ?	the old workspace chooser allowed you to move application windows between workspaces by dragging them around in the workspace chooser . i much prefer that to the new workspace chooser 's method of dragging them off the side of the screen . for one thing , in order to drag a window from a different workspace into the one i 'm working in , i have to switch workspaces twice and unmaximize a maximized window with the new method , where with the old i simply had to drag . is there anyway to get this old functionality back in ubuntu 10.04 ?

2825	how do i use `` virsh shutdown '' on kvm domains to shut down ubuntu guests ?	i am using various kvm domains on a ubuntu server . both the host and guests run 10.04.1 , 2.6.32-24 kernel , virsh reports version 0.7.5 , kvm 0.12.3 . the guests boot automatically when the host boots and they have < features > < acpi/ > < features > in their configuration . i could never manage to make virsh shutdown mydomain on the host to have any effect . it responds with domain mydomain is being shutdown and the domain keeps happily running . virsh list still lists them in the state running . virsh destroy mydomain works fine , but of course that 's not really what i want , so most of the time i log into each one and shut them down manually , which is pretty annoying . i could n't really find any information on how virsh shutdown tries to shut the domain down . pointers to useful bits of documentation are welcome . what could cause this ? how is it supposed to work ?

2830	switch user fails to complete successfully	switching users is not reliable ; when switching users , often when returning to the first logged-on user , the computer ends up a blank screen and i must turn it fully off with the power button . success is somewhat likely if a minimum of programs are running . i prefer a complete log-off , as it is . because there is a lot of screen flickering generally during these operations , i have taken care to make the monitor settings identical . but this does n't help . i use ubuntu lynx with gnome desktop . i have an nvidia 3dforce fx5600 , set to 1280x960 at 60hz ; displayed on a viewsonic vg2021m . `` desktop effects '' is set to lowest/normal ( solves bad screen-flicker issue ) . the gnome-power-manager app is removed because it caused problems when logging off . your recommendation ? update will re-install fresh with meerkat 10.10 and update this post when i see what i 've got .

2866	symlinks and their paths are confusing - how can they be used effectively ?	when exploring directories from a symlink ( symbolic link ) using nautilus or gnome commander , the directory structure is displayed as if the symlink were a regular directory . when i open a document , apps differ in how they treat the path . for an .html document : opened w/ firefox : shows the real path as the address opened w/ netbeans : ditto opened w/ gedit : shows the symlink path as the address do i need to pay attention to these varying behaviors ? i feel insecure when the symlink path is offered ( because of my windows background ) -- can i ignore that ? can i proceed with confidence , and if so , does that cover all cases ? an app will occasionally ask me if i want to preserve symlinks , treat symlinks as actual links , and so on . ( ex. , copying in gnome commander presents an option called `` follow links '' ... which i assume means symlinks ) . your guidelines for that ?
2872	what are the biggest barriers to walking the motu/developer path ?	for those who are not motu ( people who maintain the universe and multiverse software repositories ) and do not have plans of the `` i will apply to motu by $ date '' variety : what keeps you and others like you from trying to become motu ? what makes you think you could n't become one ? i 'm referring to both social and technological barriers . edit : i 'm only saying motu because it 's a pretty generic group , but `` why are n't you packaging / patching and intending to eventually try for upload rights ? '' is an even more general version .

2927	best way to remote restart ubuntu from windows machine	background : i 'm looking to put a series of ubuntu machines into retail locations , they 're being used as dumb kiosks to show a series of slides onto large lcd panel tv screens . once installed , they wo n't have a keyboard or mouse connected but will have a fixed ip on the local network . everything is configured to auto-start , no automatic updates , no power saving etc - i think we 're pretty-much good to go apart from one thing . i need the retail staff to be able to restart the boxes if a problem arises . we have vnc running ( now that we 've turned off desktop enhancements ! ) so that we can remotely get into the machines if we need to , but that 's not something we would allow the retail staff to do . the machines are going to be physically 'out of the way ' ( probably in the ceiling space ) so the power button is not easily accessible ! . i 'd like to have some means of allowing the retail staff to restart the ubuntu machine , from the desktop of one of their windows terminals . i do n't really want to give them some kind of raw terminal access ( the command line will frighten them ! ) and i do n't want them to use vnc ( as stated above ) . ideally there would be an icon on the windows desktop , they double-click it , reply to a simple 'are you sure ? ' prompt , and then the ubuntu box is told to restart . the windows side of that wo n't be a problem , we can write something using delphi , python & qt4 , whatever - it 's the ubuntu side of it i 'm stuck with . out of sight/view , could i have a windows program open a terminal across the network and tell ubuntu to restart ? is this what ssh could be used for ( i have never set that kind of thing up ) . the windows programming side is n't really an issue , it 's just that i 'm a total ubuntu noob and do n't know where to start from the platform point of view . the other thing we considered is also having the machine automatically restart itself at a set time each day ( obviously out of store hours ! ) . to me , that seems a bit unnecessary ( though forcing a restart once a week/month might be worthwhile ) . any thoughts or suggestions ? being able to restart the box on demand across the network is my prime requirement .

3043	ubuntu packaging in bzr	a while ago there was talk of moving all ( or at least some ? ) of the packaging effort to bzr branches on launchpad . i seem to remember there were a number of benefits mentioned , such as making it easier for new developers/packagers to contribute . can anyone update me on whether this happened and what the benefits would be ? ( i might have got completely the wrong end of the stick on this , so feel free to correct me ... )
3045	how to disable gnome keyring ?	i want to disable gnome keyring globally on my machine . so i deleted the lines auth optional pam_gnome_keyring.so session optional pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start in /etc/pam.d/gdm . it seems to me that this has no effect . when i lock in the syslog writes aug 24 18:37:03 foobar gnome-screensaver-dialog : gkr-pam : unlocked login keyring and another user sees a menu window where he hs to enter his credentials . so what is the correct way to disable keyring for every user on that machine ?
3050	jack and pulseaudio	i want to run pulseaudio from startup to deal with system sounds etc and be able to run jack from qjackctl for use with audio applications ( lmms , ardour , rosegarden etc ) i 'm having issues when i start up , the sound applet does not allow me to control the volume . when i click sound preferences it says `` waiting for sound system to respond '' yet the sound still plays in rhythmbox etc .
3051	how can i get a kernel core dump	we 're trying to debug a kernel panic/oops on ubuntu 10.04 . the stacktrace is n't quite enough for us . how can we configure the system to spit out a core dump and where can we find it after the crash ? there is a lot of information on how to get a user-mode core dump , but very little ( or old ) information on getting a kernel core dump . lkcd exists , but looks as though it has n't been updated since 2002 .
3055	automatically add new wireless access points	i 'm running lucid on a few laptops , with xfce as the desktop environment . before lucid , the little networkmanager tray widget would automatically scan for access points for me . now , however , i find that i have to go run iwlist myself to look for ssids ( if i do n't know one already ) and manually add that to the list . once i 've done that , then it 'll automatically connect ( if the ap is configured that way ) . part of what makes this a real pain is that the tray widget ( sometimes ) seems to not show itself at all when there 's no current connection and no known access points . i have to kill networkmanager ( which is a pain , because init really wants to re-launch it ) , run iwlist to find an ssid , go to the ( now showing ) tray widget and add the ssid , and then re-start networkmanager . i realize that the widget is just messing with a config file or two , and i 'm happy to fool with those manually , but what i 'd really like is for it to work the way it used to and just do the scan for me . note that once i 've got a connection up , then it shows me all the aps it can see , as before . i acknowledge that it 's possible i screwed up some setup file , but i 've really tried scrubbing everything back to `` as new '' state and that has n't helped . am i crazy or did that stuff really change ?
3056	how do i use a second hdmi-connected monitor ?	i 've looked around for answers to this , but nothing i 've found has been relevant , which seems a little weird but there you go . all i 'd like to do is drive a second monitor via hdmi from a laptop . from windows 7 on this laptop that works fine , of course ; it 's actually surprisingly nice . thus i know the hardware is ok. from another laptop i 've got , one with an nvidia card , the nvidia settings app seems to do the trick ( though it 's clunky ) . however , this laptop i 'm using has an intel gpu , and i ca n't find any information about how to get it to recognize that a second display is available . is it even possible to do this dynamically , or do i need to statically alter my `` xorg.conf '' to make the second screen available ? edit — sorry i should have noted that i run xfce .

3070	how do i configure touchscreen on my hp tx1000 laptop running xubuntu ?	i tried looking online for all possible solutions and even installing evtouch package , but nothing seems to work . i know that the tx1000 series laptops are notoriously linux unfriendly . does anyone have any ideas on how to get the touchscreen to work on them ?
3071	swiftfox without the file , view toolbar	is there a way to remove the file , edit , view ... toolbar from firefox ( so that i will have only the address toolbar visible ) ? i think in windows from version 3.5 you can just right click on the toolbar and you can just unselect it ... i do n't have firefox installed , i use swiftfox ...
3076	system slows down until i move the mouse	i installed a bunch of time many linux distro and never got this `` bug '' . it 's kind of weird , the system run really fine , but when there is operation like update manager or download via any browser , etc . it goes well until a moment ( never the same delay ) and radically slow down or even stop , the pc does n't freeze but the operation is paused , and when i touch the touchpad it continue . i suspected hard drive issue , so i changed it , a bios issue , except ahci i ca n't modify anything ... , also suspected that acpi stop the drive so i unchecked the box but still the same bug . if anyone has already got this ... it 's not a deadly bug but a big annoyance .
3084	how do i get a 3g usb modem to work ?	since at least jaunty , i 've tried to get my wife 's 3g usb modem to work on ubuntu , always with the same result - instant , complete system freeze . i 've tried installing ` wvdial and usb-modeswitch , i 've read tons of documentation but it gets quite disjointed from one release to the next , nothing works . i ca n't run lsusb because the system hangs immediately . i 'm using lucid and it 's a rogers `` rocket stick '' ( in canada )

3089	what can we do to increase participation in global jams ?	our global jam is coming up this weekend , and i wonder what we can do to increase participation and also collaboration between the different events . maybe we still have time to implement some of the suggestions .
3094	overriding a executable to add a default flag	here 's my boggle . i use gmplayer to play all my videos . 99.9 % of the time everything works fine but in that 1-in-1000 case , a video might be corrupted . gmplayer plays the video but it cries like an angry , hungry baby , popping up windows left , right and centre . in really bad videos this actually slows down the whole system as it spawns hundreds of error windows ( compiz applies effects , etc ) . it also steals focus and occasionally cancels christmas . in the command-line mplayer these messages are just throw out to the command line . using mplayer-proper might be an option if i ca n't use gmplayer but it 's not quite as good for my needs . i have found a workaround . if you add -msglevel all=0 to the gmplayer call , errors are suppressed . useless from a debug perspective but i 'm not attempting to debug videos here , just watch them . what i want to do is `` alias '' or `` proxy '' the gmplayer command so when you run gmplayer from the command line or by association , it actually runs gmplayer -msglevel all=0 . i gather that just adding a bash alias wo n't work for associated ( as in double clicking on a video in gnome ) plays . what are my options for hard-proxying the command . this only needs to work for one user but i 'm open to system-wide changes too .

3109	network manager or wicd ?	a couple of years ago when i first began using ubuntu i had issues with network manager and so i switched to wicd which works perfectly .

3126	upstart-supervised init script for apache ?	i want to run apache on ubuntu 10.04 , and use the nice supervision stuff in upstart ( i 'm not just talking about the apache init script , but proper service supervision a la daemontools - which is to say , restarting apache when it dies , things like that ) . does anyone have a running upstart config for supervising apache on ubuntu 10.04 ? the googles have been no help to me , but it could be that my google-fu is weak .
3127	how to write a shell script to move files from ftp server to network share drive	i have customers who upload large amounts of data to my ftp server ( an ubuntu 9.10 machine ) . once the files are uploaded , i am faced with transferring them to a local droboshare network drive so our technical support staff can retrieve them and analyze the issue . after i mount the network share at /media/ < sharename > i run this command manually to get these files : sudo mv /home/ftp/ < data_dir > / < file_name > /media/ < network_share > / < ftp_user_data > but this takes forever and if there are tens or hundreds of files , i ca n't realistically do this over and over again . i thought it would be nice to have a script that i could run periodaclly to transfer a group of these files to the network share . i can sort them as the technical support staff uses them . i am still new to linux and writing shell scripts . anyway to do this easily ? just to add to the description here , the files could be zip files , fasta files , tar.gz files , and/or txt files . also , if the zip files are large , certain zipping programs convert these to zip.001 , zip.002 , zip.003 , etc ... so the file type in this ftp directory could be quite varied . i was thinking the way i can identify these files is by simply transferring all files in the directory ( although this may take a while ) or to somewhat designate a subset of these , according to time completed or something like this . i 'm open to ideas . thanks in advance .

3137	user account messed up . how to restore functionality ?	complete story : when i installed simon tatham 's portable puzzle collection via ubuntu software center , i noticed some of the newest puzzles were missing . so i decided to get the source files and compile them myself . i uninstalled the collection and downloaded the appropriate tar.gz file from the creator 's website . when i tried make , i got many error messages and i found out i was missing some libraries . i went on installing lib-gtk-2.0 ( i think ) and my first compilation ever on linux was a success . i did n't have any decent shortcuts on the appropriate subfolder on the gnome menu ( i 'm using une ) , so i used alacarte to attach the correct images to the shortcuts . the first thing i noticed was that the other user accounts did n't have the shortcuts as well . also , all games suffered from the same problem . whenever the user opened the system menu in any game , that menu remained drawn forever on the window . i did n't like that at all , so i decided to only keep the puzzles that were missing form the original collection and reinstall the rest from ubuntu software center . i though i would at least have most of the games behaving correctly . therefore , i used alacarte again to delete the `` common '' shortcuts . after the installation though , i was n't getting any of the shortcuts on the gnome menu ( other user accounts had them correctly ) , so i decided to delete alacarte 's configuration files found inside ~/.config/ ? ( i 'm not in front of an ubuntu-running computer at the moment , so i ca n't tell for sure ) . now my user account profile is broken . when i log on , the top ( and only ) bar is not loading at all . i do n't want to mess up the profile further so i decided to stop here and ask for help . how to restore the top gnome bar missing and have my shortcuts working correctly from now on ? deleting and recreating the user account is not an option . sorry for the long story ( i believe it was necessary to explain the steps i took in order to help others help me ) . kudos to the guy who can also tell me why the system menus did n't work correctly when i compiled the games myself . update : i 'm also missing the windows title bars and borders around . also the z-order of the windows can not be changed ( gnome is not bringing the active window in front ) . finally , under `` files & folders '' no shortcuts are not working ( i 'm getting the message `` no application is registered as handling this file '' ) .

3179	closing lid freezes laptop	closing the lid on my dell studio 15 which is running ubuntu 10.04 freezes the screen . this is a new problem in ubuntu 10.04 which did not exist in 9.10 i have tried playing with all the settings in system- > preferences- > screensaver but nothing seems to make any difference . ( please note the power management settings are accessible from here so i have tried those too . ) i do n't need hibernate or suspend . i just want to be able to close the lid , and then open it and still have a working laptop . is their a settings somewhere that will make ubuntu ignore the lid closing ?

3182	alt+printscreen stopped working , how to find processes listening to events	very odd issue today . i was going to post a thread about another issue and wanted to take a screenshot of a terminal window . i got it all prepped , hit alt+printscreen and nothing happened . i went into keyboard shortcuts to see if redefining the shortcut worked . it did . i tried to set it back to alt+printscreen but the window just sat there listening for a keypress . it 's as if i never pushed a key . both the alt and printscreen keys work independently just fine ... i 've also tried looking at the output of xev as i press the keys . it hears the alt press but does n't hear the printscreen afterwards . i 've tried this from both within compiz and plain metacity . i also have a spare keyboard and that shows identical behaviour ( one keyboard is ps/2 , the spare is usb - so not a port issue ) . it 's like there 's something sitting in the event chain spitting on the event so that nothing else can hear it . my question is basically : how can you find the processes responding to certain events ? as requested : oli @ bert : ~ $ xmodmap -pke | grep -i mode keycode 82 = kp_subtract xf86_prev_vmode kp_subtract xf86_prev_vmode keycode 86 = kp_add xf86_next_vmode kp_add xf86_next_vmode keycode 100 = henkan_mode nosymbol henkan_mode keycode 203 = mode_switch nosymbol mode_switch and oli @ bert : ~ $ xmodmap -pke | grep -i print keycode 107 = print sys_req print sys_req keycode 218 = print nosymbol print edit : when i posted this i was on lucid with a home-built 2.6.35 kernel . it turns out my issue is related to the kernel and not x . somebody somewhere has decided that alt-printscreen should render a sysrq event . technically speaking , perhaps it should but this breaks what-must-be over a decade of linux and windows `` known behaviour '' .

3204	setting http proxy in awesome wm	i have installed awesome on top of ubuntu 10.04 and switch between gnome and awesome sessions ( partly because i am still learning awesome and partly because i use a few apps that require gnome desktop ) . further i need to use a proxy server @ work whereas @ home i have a direct connection . under gnome , i have defined 2 locations with gnome-network-properties ( hereafter , g-n-p ) and switch between these as needed . however , when i login to awesome , i am left with the settings as set in my last gnome session . i ca n't invoke g-n-p because it needs gnome-settings-daemon to be running which is of course not the case . if i need to change i need to logout and in twice ( once into gnome to switch location and then back into awesome ) . since i use many apps within awesome that use system proxy settings ( synaptic , firefox ) i 'd like to be able to centrally switch the proxy configuration without leaving the awesome desktop . i understand running gnome-network-properties sets some gconf-editor keys and also updates *_proxy environment vars in /etc/environment ( and probably elsewhere also ) . is there a way to achieve the same effect via a script or some replacement tool for g-n-p that does n't use gnome-settings-daemon ?
3205	higher screen resolution in virtualbox ?	i 've just installed ubuntu 10.04 into virtualbox on windows 7 . unfortunately the only options showing for screen resolution are 640x480 and 800x600 and the monitor is showing as 'unknown ' . how would i go about upping the resolution to 1280x1024 ( i 'm on a 1600x1200 monitor ) ? update i tried mounting the virtualbox 'guest additions ' iso ( from the vbox 'devices ' menu ) and doing sudo sh ./vboxlinuxadditions-x86.run from the mounted drive , which gave 2 new listed resolutions after a reboot ( 1024x768 and the 16:9 version of that resolution ) . these worked when i selected them but disappeared when i switched back to another resolution . i tried rebooting and running vboxlinuxadditions-x86.run again but onlu the 2 low res options listed this time . i think i 'm going to reinstall ... seems to be a vbox problem rather than an ubuntu problem as after reinstalling 10.4 overwriting the original virtual partition , sudo sh ./vboxlinuxadditions-x86.run now has no affect at all .

3228	can you get a source rpm to build as a deb ?	the manufacturer of our printer ( canon ) does provide linux printer drivers for most its printers . however , they are all 32bit and only the newer printer drivers are available in both deb and rpm . the older are only provided as rpm files . i use 'alien ' to convert the rpm files to the deb format so i can install the drivers . however , lately it seemed canon has screwed the new drivers for the canon pixma ip3300 up a bit in the build process of the rpms . although all printer-specific rpm packages are available , the cnijfilter-common package , containing the vital cups filter , is distributed as a source rpm ( *.src.rpm ) . very useful to build your own drivers if you want to ( 'rpmbuild -- rebuild cnijfilter-common-2.70-2.src.rpm ' ) , but not so much when you run a debian-based operating system . my question is : is it easy to convert a source rpm to something you can easily build as a deb , or will i have to manually convert the source rpm to something usable ?
3237	why does my workspace intermittantly hold at partial dimness ?	the workspace between the top and bottom gnome panels occasionally dims about 25 % and holds there for an unpredictable period of time . sometimes it never recovers to full brightness . the cursor moves but buttons are non-responsive . most often this happens in firefox but is not restricted to this one program . the top and bottom gnome panels remain fully functional . the processor stays at an approximately steady 40 % `` user '' use . the memory hovers at about a 40 % mixture of `` user '' , `` buffers '' and `` cached '' use . network and disk activities flatline . sometimes the workspace un-dims itself and returns full control . when it does not the only things that work are pressing the automatically presented force quit button , typing `` xkill '' from a terminal or choosing to restart . usually the application that dimmed can be restarted without restarting the operating system . i 've experienced this in both karmic and lucid . what am i missing ?

3421	external hard drive permissions problem with apache since 10.04 upgrade	i have a fat32 external hard drive plugged into my server at home and since upgrading to ubuntu 10.04 ( from 8.10 - it was a bug jump ! ) i 've been having permissions trouble with it . it used to be mounted as root automatically and i think the permissions were pretty much 'ignored ' . since the upgrade , it is being mounted with the group and owner being my user . obviously , i need access as my user and this is no problem still . however , i am also running a php script ( via apache ) that serves certain files to authenticated users . this is now no longer working . if i run php as my user there is no problem ( obviously ) . however , when running under www-data it can not access the drive so my script is now failing . the permissions on the drive look like this at the moment : drwx -- -- -- 1 adamnfish adamnfish -rwxrwxrwx 1 adamnfish adamnfish for folders and files respectively . it 's very clear what the problem is ( only adamnfish can access the drive ! ) but i have no idea how to fix the problem . i 've tried mounting the drive every which way and even using gui tools to try and set the bitmask properly ! the hard drive is always plugged in , but sometimes i kick its power cord while tidying up ( so the solution needs to be resilient to plugging / unplugging the drive ) and i reboot the machine from time to time ( so ideally it 'll be an fstab entry or something so i do n't need to manually unmount and remount with the correct permissions every time ) . thanks in advance , i know this will be obvious to a lot of people but i 've been pulling my hair out !
3424	chromium does n't work	my chromium browser does n't work for some reason . what i mean by that is that it does n't even start up when i click on chromium icon or choose chromium from applications menu . what might be the problem ? after typing : chromium-browser in the terminal i get this : /home/freshnrg/.themes/t-ish-brushed-overlaid/gtk-2.0/gtkrc:56 : clearlooks configuration option `` sunkenmenu '' is not supported and will be ignored . /home/freshnrg/.themes/t-ish-brushed-overlaid/gtk-2.0/gtkrc:57 : clearlooks configuration option `` menuitemstyle '' is not supported and will be ignored . /home/freshnrg/.themes/t-ish-brushed-overlaid/gtk-2.0/gtkrc:58 : clearlooks configuration option `` listviewitemstyle '' is not supported and will be ignored . /home/freshnrg/.themes/t-ish-brushed-overlaid/gtk-2.0/gtkrc:59 : clearlooks configuration option `` progressbarstyle '' is not supported and will be ignored . segmentation fault so nothing about any errors connected to chromium because all that is just my ubuntu theme errors witch i get all the time . do n't understand that segmentation fault not sure if that has anything to do with chromium . after typing : rm -rf ~/.config/chromium and then : chromium-browser chromium actually starts from scratch asking if i want to import bookmarks from firefox and it does n't matter what i choose because that is it . after that nothing happens and chromium still does n't work . re-installation did n't helped . i still get segmentation fault error . edit : i 've done all this , went back to official version 5.0.375.127 , i 've re-installed it couple of times and still nothing . i still have that segmentation fault error . edit : it 's definitely something to do with dropbox . after installing dropbox on my new account chromium stopped working . how can i get rid of dropbox on my old account as i 've uninstalled it and deleted all the files that has anything to do with dropbox but i still ca n't get chromium to work ?

3446	how to create and administer multi-architecture ppas ?	i have a program that needs to be recompiled for every ubuntu version . currently i am packaging it using ubuntu 's ppa just for the current distribution . eventually , i have to provide packages for the previous ubuntu version . i am not sure how to accomplish this . how does the ubuntu ppa build server works - does it just look at the distribution field in the most current changelog entry ( in the debian/changelog file ) to determine for what distribution the package should be build ? the debian specification allows to add multiple distributions into the distribution field . but this does not seam to help me . some ubuntu documents talk about encoding the distribution name into the version number ( in the debian changelog file ) . but how does this work in practice ? a new version of the program is available , then what ? do i add for each distribution a new changelog entry and the ppa buildserver builds automatically for each distribution new packages after dput'ing it up ? or does the ppa buildserver just looks at the first changelog entry ?

3469	sound applet disappeared and wo n't come back	recently ( i do n't do n't know when , might have been after and update ) the sound indicator disappeared from my panel , in addition i have n't been getting any sound either . i tried installing the indicator-sound package , but all i got was this error message : the following packages have unmet dependencies : indicator-sound : depends : libido-0.1-0 ( > = 0.1.1 ) but it is not going to be installed e : broken packages seems to be a bug , but how do i get around it ? could i install and older version of libido ? if so , how do i do that ? everything had worked fine until a couple days ago , so i 'm sure that the package is the problem . edit : the command $ dpkg -- get-selections | grep libido returns the following output : libido-0.1-0 deinstall edit2 : ok , that 's embarassing . yesterday i uninstalled and reinstalled the libido package half a dozen times , and the indicator-sound package kept reporting the same error . today , however , i just installed the libido package and now the indicator-sound package installed with no errors . maybe the system needed a reboot or something . ( should i answer my own question or just wait for a moderator to close it ? )

'' i 'm a little concerned given ati 's historically poor linux performance . have things changed that much ? i contacted system76 and they said they regularly offer both ati and nvidia on and off , and that ati cards give more bang for the buck . really ? with linux ?
3476	grub no longer boots after kernel update ( second time now )	some weeks ago i configured a dual boot laptop to run xubuntu 10.4 on the third partition of my disk ( i.e . i had to set the installation location manually ) . everything was fine until i had installed the bunch of automatic updates ( including a new kernel ) , which were discovered after wifi was finally working . after rebooting , grub did n't boot into xubuntu anymore ( which it did several times before ) , but just showed a prompt . i managed to get the system repaired using a live cd and a good hour of internet reading . for some weeks everything was fine , including automatic updates . yesterday i got a new kernel through automatic updates . and guess what ? the laptop refused to boot afterwards . to me it looks like every kernel update makes my system unbootable . how can i prevent this besides the obvious `` do n't install updates '' ? is there anything else i should inspect or monitor on that system ? or are my conclusions about the kernel update completely wrong and i should look for something else causing these symptomes ? edit : some more details as asked in the comments : i did n't start windows between the update and the crash , so for me it seems to be related to xubuntu only . grub is grub2 ( version 1.98something ) . /boot/grub/grub.cfg looks like this : # # do not edit this file # # it is automatically generated by /usr/sbin/grub-mkconfig using templates # from /etc/grub.d and settings from /etc/default/grub # # # # begin /etc/grub.d/00_header # # # if [ -s $ prefix/grubenv ] ; then load_env fi set default= '' 0 '' if [ $ { prev_saved_entry } ] ; then set saved_entry= $ { prev_saved_entry } save_env saved_entry set prev_saved_entry= save_env prev_saved_entry set boot_once=true fi function savedefault { if [ -z $ { boot_once } ] ; then saved_entry= $ { chosen } save_env saved_entry fi } function recordfail { set recordfail=1 if [ -n $ { have_grubenv } ] ; then if [ -z $ { boot_once } ] ; then save_env recordfail ; fi ; fi } insmod ext2 set root= ' ( hd0,5 ) ' search -- no-floppy -- fs-uuid -- set c1550ae8-66af-414c-874d-15cb43176ba5 if loadfont /usr/share/grub/unicode.pf2 ; then set gfxmode=640x480 insmod gfxterm insmod vbe if terminal_output gfxterm ; then true ; else # for backward compatibility with versions of terminal.mod that don't # understand terminal_output terminal gfxterm fi fi insmod ext2 set root= ' ( hd0,5 ) ' search -- no-floppy -- fs-uuid -- set c1550ae8-66af-414c-874d-15cb43176ba5 set locale_dir= ( $ root ) /boot/grub/locale set lang=de insmod gettext if [ $ { recordfail } = 1 ] ; then set timeout=-1 else set timeout=10 fi # # # end /etc/grub.d/00_header # # # # # # begin /etc/grub.d/05_debian_theme # # # set menu_color_normal=white/black set menu_color_highlight=black/light-gray # # # end /etc/grub.d/05_debian_theme # # # # # # begin /etc/grub.d/10_linux # # # menuentry 'ubuntu , mit linux 2.6.32-24-generic ' -- class ubuntu -- class gnu-linux -- class gnu -- class os { recordfail insmod ext2 set root= ' ( hd0,5 ) ' search -- no-floppy -- fs-uuid -- set c1550ae8-66af-414c-874d-15cb43176ba5 linux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-generic root=uuid=c1550ae8-66af-414c-874d-15cb43176ba5 ro quiet splash initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.6.32-24-generic } menuentry 'ubuntu , mit linux 2.6.32-24-generic ( wiederherstellungsmodus ) ' -- class ubuntu -- class gnu-linux -- class gnu -- class os { recordfail insmod ext2 set root= ' ( hd0,5 ) ' search -- no-floppy -- fs-uuid -- set c1550ae8-66af-414c-874d-15cb43176ba5 echo 'linux 2.6.32-24-generic wird geladen …' linux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-generic root=uuid=c1550ae8-66af-414c-874d-15cb43176ba5 ro single echo 'initiale ramdisk wird geladen …' initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.6.32-24-generic } menuentry 'ubuntu , mit linux 2.6.32-21-generic ' -- class ubuntu -- class gnu-linux -- class gnu -- class os { recordfail insmod ext2 set root= ' ( hd0,5 ) ' search -- no-floppy -- fs-uuid -- set c1550ae8-66af-414c-874d-15cb43176ba5 linux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.32-21-generic root=uuid=c1550ae8-66af-414c-874d-15cb43176ba5 ro quiet splash initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.6.32-21-generic } menuentry 'ubuntu , mit linux 2.6.32-21-generic ( wiederherstellungsmodus ) ' -- class ubuntu -- class gnu-linux -- class gnu -- class os { recordfail insmod ext2 set root= ' ( hd0,5 ) ' search -- no-floppy -- fs-uuid -- set c1550ae8-66af-414c-874d-15cb43176ba5 echo 'linux 2.6.32-21-generic wird geladen …' linux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.32-21-generic root=uuid=c1550ae8-66af-414c-874d-15cb43176ba5 ro single echo 'initiale ramdisk wird geladen …' initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.6.32-21-generic } # # # end /etc/grub.d/10_linux # # # # # # begin /etc/grub.d/20_memtest86+ # # # menuentry `` memory test ( memtest86+ ) '' { insmod ext2 set root= ' ( hd0,5 ) ' search -- no-floppy -- fs-uuid -- set c1550ae8-66af-414c-874d-15cb43176ba5 linux16 /boot/memtest86+.bin } menuentry `` memory test ( memtest86+ , serial console 115200 ) '' { insmod ext2 set root= ' ( hd0,5 ) ' search -- no-floppy -- fs-uuid -- set c1550ae8-66af-414c-874d-15cb43176ba5 linux16 /boot/memtest86+.bin console=ttys0,115200n8 } # # # end /etc/grub.d/20_memtest86+ # # # # # # begin /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober # # # menuentry `` microsoft windows xp professional ( on /dev/sda1 ) '' { insmod ntfs set root= ' ( hd0,1 ) ' search -- no-floppy -- fs-uuid -- set 883cb1b73cb1a09c drivemap -s ( hd0 ) $ { root } chainloader +1 } # # # end /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober # # # # # # begin /etc/grub.d/40_custom # # # # this file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries . simply type the # menu entries you want to add after this comment . be careful not to change # the 'exec tail ' line above . # # # end /etc/grub.d/40_custom # # #
3481	does firefox have something similar to activex in terms of security vulnerabilities ?	people always say that linux is more secure than windows . the main reason seems to be the general system design philosophy and the fact that users are users and not root . one main security concern when using windows and internet explorer seem to be activex . every few days i read about another kind of exploit using activex , and almost always the workaround is to deactivate activex . i read that so often i wonder why people bother to activate activex at all . ( one reason might be that the name contains `` active '' ; another might be the windows update function . ) using ubuntu and firefox , i always feel so safe when reading about the activex exploits . i know that there are many other security vulnerabilities that use javascript and/or adobe flash , but as far as i understand those kind of security vulnerabilities can only do as much damage as my user rights allow . of course that does n't help much when the malware wants to destroy all of my data - but most malware today only wants to use my pc as a botnet drone and so is not interested in destroying my data . so the question again : does firefox running under ubuntu have something similar to activex , in terms of security vulnerabilities ? another question which may be identical : can a security vulnerability involving adobe flash and/or javascript be `` easily '' exploited to do as much damage as an activex exploit ? when i say `` easy '' i mean that the attack does not need to exploit another component of the system to elevate user rights . for example , an exploit involving adobe flash will gain access to my pc using my user rights , and then proceed to exploit some known vulnerability in x to gain root access . that is not `` easy '' .

3498	madwifi vs. ndiswrapper	i 'm going to try and setup wifi on a computer with ubuntu installed where it does n't work out of the box . the computer is an acer veriton l460 with a ar5001 wifi card . there are two options as far as i know : use madwifi use ndiswrapper there are steps for using madwifi here : http : //ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php ? t=1305514 some hints for ndiswrapper are here : http : //ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-240280.html . the driver seems to be available here : http : //www.netgate.com/support/drivers/sta_24071bin/install/ . so my questions are , are there any other types of ways to do this ? are there any positives and negatives for chosing madwifi or ndiswrapper ? has anyone had success installing this particular wifi card in ubuntu , and if so what did you use ?
3502	non-ascii characters show as boxes in textbox of vb.net application under mono	i 'm running ubuntu 9.10 ( ca n't upgrade due to some applications being incompatible with later versions ) , with all updates installed . a colleague has written a vb.net application which seems to run correctly under mono , however there is an issue with characters in text boxes : if they are not strictly ascii , they show as boxes ( the typical windows replacement character ) . at first i thought it was an issue with greek characters ( which we use ) ; however , i attempted to insert some accented western characters ( like é , which is in the typical western 1252 windows codepage ) , and these too showed up as boxes too , so it 's not strictly an issue with greek . i attempted to type greek in a textbox : the word « δοκιμή » ( test ) . i then selected what i typed , pressed ctrl-c , switched to a native text editor and pressed ctrl-v . the result was “ îî¿îºî¹î¼î® ” , which is the greek word pretty messed up ( think utf-8 interpreted as latin-1 ; i work a lot with unicode , so it 's easy to recognise such stuff : ) however , if you want to verify , start a python interpreter in a utf-8 capable terminal and try : > > > a= '' îî¿îºî¹î¼î® '' > > > print a.decode ( `` utf8 '' ) .encode ( `` latin1 '' ) .decode ( `` utf8 '' ) δοκιμή which is what i typed ) . now , the application also embeds an internet explorer control ; mono does well emulating it ( i think it uses a gecko engine ) , and in a textbox inside that ie control , i can type fine and see any non-ascii character i want . i would like to know whether there is an issue with my mono configuration or even if it 's a known bug ; vb.net is supposedly unicode-capable , but i do n't know anything about the unicode-capability of the standard controls it uses . so , if you can help me , please advise : what can i do on the ubuntu side to remedy the situation ?

3554	how to make my proxy settings change depending on the network i connect to ?	my company 's corporate network requires me to set a network proxy to access the net , but when i am anywhere else , i do n't need it . the proxy settings in ubuntu ( system - > preferences - > proxy server ) allowed me to create `` locations '' that i can manually select . then i have a `` default '' location ( with no proxy ) and a `` work '' location ( with my company 's proxy in it ) . is there a way to make ubuntu automatically select the `` work '' location based on the connection i 'm using ? i thought i could use the ip subnet ( very specific ) to detect where i am , but i have no idea how to set it up ... edit : i really need to have the proxy settings set at the system level . all my network connections ( imap , smtp , chat , etc ) need to go through the proxy . not only the web browser .

3618	how can i use cron to schedule a script that implements daylight saving on a non- dst aware application when my server automatically uses dst ?	my server ( running ubuntu 8.04lts server ) reports the time as 9:38pm bst right now . bst ( british summer time ) is 1 hour ahead of utc ( or greenwich mean time if you really want to confuse matters ) the act of parliament defines that we in the uk use bst for the period beginning at one o'clock , greenwich mean time , in the morning of the last sunday in march and ending at one o'clock , greenwich mean time , in the morning of the last sunday in october . no problems scheduling this in cron but i do n't know what date format/timezone i should be using . do i set it to move forward at 1am but back at 2am when it ends ? that makes sense if the machine uses bst but then i worry that that cron will not trigger at 2am because the system clock might get reset back to 1am before it has a chance to trigger - thus making my script run 1 hour late . or does it just use utc ?

3720	loading/shutdown gui problems ?	i am using a partition created from wubi , and this is only because windows is needed for activities like gaming and watching movies on certain websites that require the silverlight plugin . all of the partitions i have created in the past have worked fine . this new install , however , has a problem . i formated a month or so back to allow more space . back then , i only created a partition that allowed for a few gigs of space . i deleted the partition in windows and gave myself the 30gb partition . this is because i planned to work from my ubuntu partition entirely except for the above-mentioned things . it worked fine for a week or so . then , for some reason , the ubuntu loading screen ( the purple one with the four or five red dots that slowly light up ) went wrong . instead of coming to this screen from start-up in my native resolution of 1440x900 and having the dots all light up before the operating system presented the login screen , the system waited a while at the screen with the blinking underscore , then quickly flashed green , presented the purple ubuntu screen in a low resolution , allowed time for only 2 or 3 dots to light up , and the instantly took me to the login screen . this was originally only a problem with start-up . however , it is now a problem with shutdown too , and i fear it might be detrimental to my system the way it works . whenever i shut down , the same purple ubuntu screen comes up in low resolution . there is no green flash here . it just appears after my programs are assumed to have closed . the dots begin to light up , and after only a couple of the dots light up as opposed to all of them , the system suddenly just shuts down . lately , it has also had some other problems . these happen every once in a while as in every three or four days . when i go to shut down , the purple ubuntu screen will appear but without the dots yet still in a low resolution mode . there will be some text over the logo as if it is a terminal outputting information from the system about closing programs , killing the system , and so on . sometimes this text appears for a short while before the shutdown . other times , my system has actually been stuck on this screen ; requiring a hard shutdown . in fact , when i installed kubuntu desktop environment a few weeks back ( this was after the problem , so it 's not kde ) , i shut down my computer and went to bed without confirming it had shut down . when i woke up , my computer had literally sat all night at the kubuntu logo display screen ; having failed to shut down . does anyone know what the problem is ? i do n't think it 's my graphics card or processor or anything , even though both of them currently have their problems . windows loads fine . the ubuntu partition works fine when i am working in it . there are no problems elsewhere . i do not remember installing any software that would do this . the last big modification to my system around the time this started were simple changes of my desktop wallpaper .

3750	what precautions should i take when exposing my desktop directly to the internet ?	i 've always used my ubuntu desktop behind the security of a router with nat , but there have been a few times when i 've had to plug it directly into an active cable modem . in general , what precautions i should be taking in situations when my computer is exposed to the internet like this for extended periods of time ? specifics that immediately come to mind are : are there any default network services i might want to disable ? is there a need to modify the default firewall configuration ? should i be concerned about services using password authentication ? what kind of logging can i do to be notified of unauthorized access ? i realize that questions like this are just the tip of the iceberg of expansive topics that entire professions are based upon , so let me make clear : what i 'm looking for are a few straightforward recommendations of best practices or configuration changes that a desktop user would find useful in a default ubuntu installation .
3759	change directory ( cd ) but by replacing a part of the path only	not sure if it is possible , but i seem to remember from my old days using aix it was possible to change my path by just saying which part of the path needed to be replaced by something else . for instance , say i have two paths : /etc/application-2.0.1/options/default and /etc/application-1.0.8/options/default that i could switch from folder 1 to 2 using a command like cd /2.0.1/1.0.8/ which would replace , in the path , the string 2.0.1 to 1.0.8 . obviously this does not work for me now . but is there a way to do this ?

3805	how can i reduce the time taken to login by postponing/delaying some startup applications ?	i have setup some applications to startup on each login ( e.g. , redshift-gtk , gtg ) automatically but after adding these to startup applications ( system - > preferences - > startup applications ) obviously the time taken to login has increased . due to all this the time it takes for my panels , desktop etc to appear is too long - until which i am forced to wait . i do n't need these apps to be available immediately , but it would be good if they startup eventually , meanwhile the ubuntu menu/panel is available for running other apps that i might need to . i tried using at command , with the intention of editing all startup applications to put the commands in the at queue , but this did n't work since the apps do n't get the necessary environment variables ( like display ) . is this what nice command is used for ? any other ideas how i can accomplish this ? if possible , i would like to avoid editing the startup applications commands , since this would mean a lot of effort to replicate on other machines i use .

3981	start a second x session with different resolution and sound	i have two screens hooked together with twinview . some applications treat it as one big 3840*1200 panel but that 's pretty undesirable in first person shooters as your sights end up in the gap between the two screens . so i usually run wine games in a 1920*1200px window . the window manager makes it full-screen on one screen and that works great for some games . however some games lag and that allows the mouse to fly out the side of the wine window , causing my player to spin like a fox on drugs . and then there are a whole load of native games ( x3 , openarena , quake4 , quakewars , etc ) that do n't have a good windowed mode . using windowed mode on x3 results in the mouse becoming uber-sensitive . would n't it be nice if i could launch some games in a new x session that just used one screen ? ! it would . i 've got as far as this for steam : # ! /bin/sh x :3 -ac & nvidia-settings -- load-config-only sleep 10 # wait for x to catch up cd ~/.wine/drive_c/program\ files/steam/ display=:3 winedebug=-all wine `` steam.exe '' now this technically uses two screens but when games launch in fullscreen mode once they 've already been set to 1920*1200 , they seem to adapt and use one of my xorg.conf metamodes . it would be better if i could explicitly state the mode in this executable . is there a way to do that ? there 's also no sound . i 've got the winepulse patch so i just need to get pulseaudio hooked into this session ( or vice versa ) and i 'm good to go for now , i think . edit : ralf picked up on a few things but missed ( or misconstrued ) some others . this is probably down to my over-verbose question . despite the length of the post , i only have two problems . here are my problems in a succinct setting : how can i start a new x session with a specified resolution ? i would preferably like to specify an existing metamode or the exact resolution when i call x . how can i get applications on the new x session talking with the right pulseaudio server ? at the moment , they do n't seem to line up . i 've tested this with totem , not just wine apps .
3982	is there a significant disadvantage to aliasing rm to do something else ?	i 've been bitten a few times recently with rming things i should n't have - for example , forgetting to ulink symlinks , not rm them . i 'm thinking of writing a small bash script to simply move the target to ~/.local/share/trash , as i have n't grasped restoring files ( seems to involve a lot of linux hackery that i 'm not going to achieve any time soon ) . the only problems i can think of are : scripts/applications needing to rm files ( really a problem ? i could also get used to calling rm ! or something ) , files being moved to trash while files there already have the same name ( not sure how ubuntu get 's around that at the moment , could be fixed by appending md5 ( name + time ( ) ) to the name . of course the real answer 's in backing up or just learning not to do silly things but i 'd like an accommodating solution none-the-less . is this a really terrible idea or something that could be done ?
3983	what does the ctrl-alt-+ shortcut do ?	simple question . i was about to assign the ctrl+alt++ keyboard shortcut to increase the volume , but i then realized it was already assigned for something . if i press this key combination the screen flashes black for a second , and then comes back . pressing ctrl+alt+- produces similar behavior . so i 'm curious , what 's this shortcut supposed to do ?
